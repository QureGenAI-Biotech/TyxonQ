Quick Example
=============

Here are simple examples showing both quantum circuit construction and quantum chemistry applications:

**Basic Quantum Circuit**

.. code-block:: python

   import tyxonq as tq

   # Create a 2-qubit circuit
   circuit = tq.Circuit(2)
   circuit.h(0)
   circuit.cnot(0, 1)
   circuit.measure_all()

   # Compile and execute
   compiled = circuit.compile()
   result = compiled.device('statevector').run(shots=1000)
   
   print(result.counts)
   # Output: {'00': 500, '11': 500} (approximately)

**Quantum Chemistry Calculation**

.. code-block:: python

   from tyxonq.applications.chem import UCCSD, HEA
   from tyxonq.applications.chem.molecule import h2

   # UCCSD calculation for H2 molecule
   uccsd = UCCSD(h2, run_fci=True)
   uccsd_energy = uccsd.kernel(runtime="numeric")
   
   # Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA) calculation
   hea = HEA.ry(uccsd.int1e, uccsd.int2e, uccsd.n_elec, uccsd.e_core, 
                layers=3, runtime="device")
   hea_energy = hea.kernel(shots=0, provider="simulator", device="statevector")
   
   print(f"HF energy:    {h2.hf_energy:.6f} Hartree")
   print(f"UCCSD energy: {uccsd_energy:.6f} Hartree")
   print(f"HEA energy:   {hea_energy:.6f} Hartree")
   # Expected output shows correlation energy capture
