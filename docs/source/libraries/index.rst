   .. grid-item-card:: üé® Circuit Templates
      :link: circuits_library/index
      :link-type: doc

      Pre-built parameterized circuits for VQE, QAOA, UCC, and other quantum algorithms.

   .. grid-item-card:: ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Kernels
      :link: quantum_library/index
      :link-type: doc

      Low-level quantum computational kernels for statevector, density matrix, and MPS simulations.

   .. grid-item-card:: üß¨ Hamiltonian Encoding
      :link: hamiltonian_encoding/index
      :link-type: doc

      Tools for fermion-to-qubit mappings, Pauli term grouping, and efficient Hamiltonian representation.

   .. grid-item-card:: üìà Optimizers
      :link: optimizer/index
      :link-type: doc

      Advanced optimization algorithms including SOAP and interoperability with SciPy.

Architectural Philosophy
========================

The library design follows these principles:

**Modularity**
   Each library is self-contained and can be used independently

**Composability**
   Libraries work together seamlessly for complex workflows

**Performance**
   Optimized implementations with GPU support where applicable

**Flexibility**
   Extensible APIs allowing custom components

**Integration**
   Deep integration with TyxonQ's compiler and device abstraction
