## Introduction
This document explores the implementation and optimization of vectorized operations using `vmap` in the TyxonQ framework, with a focus on two key examples: `matprod_vmap.py` and `vmap_randomness.py`. The analysis covers how `vmap` enables efficient batched computation by transforming scalar operations into vectorized kernels, the interaction between `vmap`, JIT compilation, and random number generation, and the performance implications across different matrix shapes and backends. Special attention is given to the behavior of stateful operations under vectorization and the practical considerations for applications such as Monte Carlo simulations, quantum circuit evaluations, and stochastic gradient estimation.

## Core Vectorization Mechanism with vmap
The `vmap` function in TyxonQ provides a higher-order transformation that automatically vectorizes a given function across one or more axes of its input tensors. It is implemented as a thin wrapper around backend-specific vectorization capabilities, such as `torch.func.vmap` in PyTorch. When `vmap
